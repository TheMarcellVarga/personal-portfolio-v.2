We have used a digital way of displaying it, using Adobe XD, since we believe it's easier to visualize than using a paper version.  According to the landing page, we had a few iterations of displaying elements. In the navigation bar, we displayed different page labels- Available Programs, Service, Contact, and Apply page, to show the website structure, and would make it to be sticky and follow when scrolling down, to let the user navigate more easily to other pages.
